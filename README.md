# Movies API

This is a small RESTful API for managing a collection of movies, providing basic CRUD operations on Movie resources. This project does not include a front-end interface, focusing entirely on the back-end development and API functionality. It was implemented using **Spring Boot** with an embedded H2 database for data storage.


## Project Requirements:

- **Java Version**: 17 or higher
- **Build Tool**: Maven 3.6.3 or higher. You can check your installed Maven version by running the following command:

```bash
  mvn --version
```


## How to Run the Application

I have already built the JAR file so to run the application just follow these simple steps:

1.**Navigate to the target directory**. Open your command prompt, and navigate to the target directory where the JAR file is located.

```bash 
cd path\to\your\project\target
```
   
2.**Run the JAR file**. Use the following command to start the application:

```bash
java -jar moviesapi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
````
   
3.**Access the application**. The server should now be running on: ``http://localhost:8080``


## Movie Resource

Each movie in the application has the following attributes:

- **id** (Long): A unique identifier for the movie, automatically generated by the database.
- **title** (String): The title of the movie.
- **launch date** (LocalDate): The release date of the movie in the format yyyy-MM-dd.
- **rating** (BigDecimal): The movie's rating, ranging from 0.0 to 10.0, allowing up to one digit after the decimal point.
- **revenue** (Long): The total revenue of the movie in USD.

Movie Resource Example (JSON):

```JSON 
{
  "title": "Inception",
  "launchDate": "2010-07-16",
  "rating": 8.8,
  "revenue": 825786894
}
```


## API Endpoints

Here are the endpoints for interacting with the API, categorized by their functionality:

### 1. Get All Movies
- **GET** /api/movies
- Retrieves a list with all the movies in the database.

Example:
- **GET** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies``
  

### 2. Get Movies by launch date
- **GET** /api/movies/launchDate/{date}
- Retrieves a list of movies with the same launch date.

Example:
- **GET** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies/launchDate/1994-10-14``


### 3. Get a Movie by id
- **GET** /api/movies/{id}
- Retrieves a specific movie identified by its unique ID.

Example:
- **GET** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies/1``
 

### 4. Add a New Movie
- **POST** /api/movies
- Adds a new movie to the database.

Example:
- **POST** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies``
- Content-Type: application/json
- Body:  

```JSON 
{
  "title": "Inception",
  "launchDate": "2010-07-16",
  "rating": 8.8,
  "revenue": 825786894
}
```
          
          
### 5. Add all movies from a list
- **POST** /api/movies/list
- Adds a list of movies to the database.

Example:
- **POST** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies/list``
- Content-Type: application/json
- Body:

```JSON
[
  {
    "title": "Pulp Fiction",
    "launchDate": "1994-10-14",
    "rating": 8.9,
    "revenue": 212891598
  },
  {
    "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
    "launchDate": "1994-09-23",
    "rating": 9.3,
    "revenue": 28713353
  },
  {
    "title": "The Godfather",
    "launchDate": "1972-03-24",
    "rating": 9.2,
    "revenue": 270007394
  }
]
```

### 6. Update a movie by id
- **PUT** /api/movies/{id}
- Updates the movie identified by its unique ID using the details of the provided movie.

Example:
- **PUT** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies/1``
- Content-Type: application/json
- Body:

```JSON
{
  "title": "Inception updated",
  "launchDate": "2010-07-16",
  "rating": 9.0,
  "revenue": 825786894
}
```

### 7. Delete a Movie by id
- **DELETE** /api/movies/{id}
- Removes the movie identified by its unique ID from the database.

Example:
- **DELETE** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies/2``


### 8. Delete all movies
- **DELETE** /api/movies
- Removes all the movies from the database.

Example:
- **DELETE** ``http://localhost:8080/api/movies``

## Conclusion

Working on this project has been an incredible learning experience. Along the way, Iâ€™ve gained a deeper understanding of Spring Boot's architecture and its powerful features for building scalable and maintainable RESTful APIs. Iâ€™ve honed my skills in designing and implementing API endpoints, managing application configurations, and using Spring Boot's dependency injection to simplify development. I also learned how to work with embedded databases like H2, using the JDBC API for database operations which gave me a clearer picture of how data persistence works in modern applications, from setting up schemas and running queries to troubleshooting database issues. It has also helped me develop a stronger grasp of backend development best practices, including error handling, testing, and optimizing performance. 

Working with Spring Boot has shown me how its simplicity and flexibility make it a great tool for reducing repetitive tasks and creating a better development experience.
